## Branching Structure
* Each module will be implemented in their own branch
* Main will have completely working code that will ultimately bring together all the modules. 

## Module Documentation
Please look at individual branches for an overall description of the module. Each module will have separate files for separate functions. These files have documentation on how the interface works and specifics on how each function performs its supposed job. 
Each function will have, at the beginning of the file, a short summary of what its intended purpose is and what the data input and output look like.
